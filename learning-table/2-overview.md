# 1. What is creenv ?

In modern days, the javascript ecosystem has became more and more powerful, slowly growing in the strain of es6. But with great power comes great responsibility. And that's exactly what happened to the ecosystem: it became bigger and bigger, some more packages became **required** to build a decent project, while some offered less important but still desirable functionalities. And by becoming such a big monster, it is now really -*too*- hard and time consuming to setup an es6 project and have a decent workflow. **At some point, I used to clone the same repo at each new project to start from a correct boilerplate**. But still. Problems persists. Some vector classes from the internet don't interact really well with other libraries. Canvas are a pain to use. Rendering your work to a video ? Oh god if you're not familiar with the web API's and the javascript, it must be terrible troubles.
